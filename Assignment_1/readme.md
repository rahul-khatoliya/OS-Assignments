Understanding Program Compilation Process

This first exercise is aimed to take you through the compilation process. You
task would be write out a simple C program – hello.c, that would have two
local variables intialised to some values. Thereafter, you print them out via
printf() function and exit the program. Your task is to use gcc compiler to
walk through all the steps of compilation. The first step would be to pause at
the pre-processing step. You need to explain the output of the pre-processing,
based on the output file (derived by pausing the compilation at the preprocessing
step). Thereafter, you need go via all the compilation steps and pause at each
step, save the output file and explain the contents in each of these output files.
You would require to refer to the manpages for gcc for the same.
What To Submit
• Program source code with Makefile to compile and pause the compilation
at each phase.
• Write-up describing the following:

– Gcc command-line options that pauses the compilation of the pro-
gram at each step, along with their descriptions.

– Description the outcomes of each step involving the description of
the output file.
