REASON FOR THE CHANGE IN PROGRAM :

SINCE WE KNOW THAT , EVERY VARIABLES , POINTERS DECLARED IN MAIN METHOD OF C PROGRAM GET STORED IN THE STACK , WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN THE RAM (RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY) , MOREOVER THEY ALL ARE CLEARED/REMOVED , WHEN THE PROGRAM EXECUTION IS FINISHED , THUS NOTHING IS STORED IN THE DISK AND SO DOES OUR STRING DECLARED IN C PROGRAM .

WHEREAS IF WE CREATE A PROGRAM IN WHICH WE EXPLICITLY CREATE A FILE(.TXT) AND TRY TO STORE OUR STRING IN THAT FILE IN OUR C PROGRAM , THEN IT WILL REMAIN INSIDE THE FILE , NO MATTER WHAT YOUR PROGRAM STATUS IS , WHETHER FINSHED OR NOT , HENCE WE CAN SAY THAT THIS STRING IS STORED IN OUR DISKS RATHER THAN RAM(RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY) .
