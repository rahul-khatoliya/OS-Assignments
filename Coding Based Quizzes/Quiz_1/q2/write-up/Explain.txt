# EXPLANATION OF WARNINGS :

1.    test.c:1:1: warning: return type defaults to ‘int’ [-Wimplicit-int]
      | add(float a, float b){
      | ^~~ 
   
--> THE FIRST EVER WARNING IS STATING THAT YOU HAVE'NT EXPLICITLY MENTIONED ANY RETURN TYPE TO THIS FUNCTION , WHILE YOU STILL ARE RETURNING SOME RESULT . 
    THEREFORE, WE NEED TO DECLARE THE RETURN TYPE AS WELL BEFOFE THE COMPLILING TO GET RID OF THIS WARNING .
    
   
2.    test.c:2:18: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘round’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
      |  return (float) (round(a)+round(b));
      |                  ^~~~~ 

--> THE SECOND WARNING ARISE , BECAUSE THE COMPILER DOES'NT GET ANY DECLARATION AND DEFINITION OF THE FUNCTION ‘round’ , WHEREAS WITHOUT EXPLICITLY PROVIDING 
    THE METHOD SIGNATURE AND DECLARATION , WE ARE CALLING/INVOKING IT . THUS IT MAKES NO SENSE TO COMPILER , AND RESULTS IN THIS WARNING .
    
    
3.    test.c:2:18: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘round’
      test.c:1:1: note: include ‘<math.h>’ or provide a declaration of ‘round’
      +++ |+#include <math.h>
          | add(float a, float b){
          
-->  SINCE WE HAVE'NT PROVIDED ANY EXPLICIT DECLARATION OF THE METHOD ‘round’ THEREFORE THE COMPILER IS UNABLE TO FIND ANY DEFINITION OF THIS IN THE PROGRAM AND 
     CLAIMING THAT INCOMPATIBLE IMPLICIT DECLARATION . MOREOVER THE COMPILER IS PROVIDING US SUGGESTION , WHETHER WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE  ‘round’ THAT IS PRESENT 
     IN THE LIBRARY <math.h> , AND IF SO , THEN YOU MUST INCLUDE IT AS A HEADER FILE , ALSO THE COMPILER IS GIVING EXACT LOCATION AND SYNTAX WHERE WE HAVE TO ADD THIS CODE .
